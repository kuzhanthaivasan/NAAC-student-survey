        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">NAAC's instrument is developed to&nbsp;assess and grade institutions of higher&nbsp;education through a three-step-process&nbsp;and make the outcome as objective as&nbsp;possible. Though the methodology and&nbsp;the broad framework of the instrument is&nbsp;similar, there is a slight difference in the&nbsp;focus of the instrument depending on the&nbsp;unit of Accreditation, i.e., Affiliated /&nbsp;Constituent colleges / Autonomous&nbsp;colleges / Universities / Health Science / Teacher / Physical Education.

            <br><br>
            <p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 15px;">Institutions, which would like to make an improvement in the accredited status, may volunteer for re-assessment, after completing at least one year, but not after the completion of three years. The option can be exercised only once in a cycle. Re-assessed institution cannot come for another re-assessment in the same cycle. The current procedures and methodology including the manual for the Assessment and Accreditation is applicable for all institutions applying for re-assessment. The fee structure and other process would be as per the current procedures of Assessment and Accreditation (more details can be obtained from NAAC website). Institutions that volunteer for re-assessment will not be eligible for fee waiver and reimbursement of accreditation expenses.</p>
